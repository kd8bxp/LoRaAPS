# LoRaAPS (LoRa Amateur Packet Service)

This project was inspired by Travis Goodspeeds LoRaHam project, and Elvis Pfutzenreuter's LoRaMaDor project.  
This project uses LoRa harware, TTGO LoRa32-Oled, LoRa32u4, and TTGO T-Beam v1. It should be easy to adapt for other boards.  
Full project details can be found here http://kd8bxp.blogspot.com/2020/09/lora-radio-for-amateur-radio-operator.html for more information.  

## Disclaimer

Use this at your own risk, while I believe it is working the way I think it should, testing has been limited. It's hard to test some of the features on the work bench. A wide test is needed.  

There is no guarantee a message will be delivered to the intended person, this should not be used to pass "emergancy" traffic. Please use reliable well tested radios for any and all emergancy traffic.  

Traffic sent over the internet should be considered to be sent in the clear, in otherwords do not send private or personal information, or otherwise sentive information. The whole network should be considered to be in the clear, although there will be a limited number of people to hear OTA traffic (at this point.)  

This project should be considered to be experimental, expect firmware to be updated. Keep this in mind if you want to deloy remote stations - you may need away to update the firmware easy.
